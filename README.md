# S-P-500-Stock-Price-Forecasting-using-LSTM

Project Objective
To build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:

Preprocesses and enriches raw S&P 500 historical data with technical indicators

Trains an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict daily price movements

Evaluates the model with realistic financial metrics

Visualizes model performance and 30-day forward forecasts

Extracts insights for retail or institutional portfolio decision-making


Technical Stack
Data Source: Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, scikit-learn

Indicators: Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, EMAs, SMAs, Price Momentum

Modeling: LSTM with MinMax scaling, time-window sequences, validation splits

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (for insight and residual plots)
